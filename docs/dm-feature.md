# DM (Direct Messages) Feature

## Overview

End-to-end encrypted 1:1 messaging built on top of NIP-17 (Private Direct Messages) / NIP-59 (Gift Wrap) / NIP-44 v2 (encryption). DMs use a **dedicated encryption keypair** separate from the user's Nostr identity key, so the identity signer (NIP-07 extension, nsec, Amber, etc.) never has to decrypt DMs on its own — the decryption key lives in the app and can be synced across devices via a lightweight "Client Key / Key Transfer" protocol.

The code in this feature is largely self-contained inside `src/services/dm.service.ts`, `src/services/encryption-key.service.ts`, `src/services/nip17-gift-wrap.service.ts`, and `src/services/crypto-file.service.ts`. Building an independent DM app should mostly mean lifting these four services plus the IndexedDB schema described below.

## Relevant NIPs

- **NIP-17**: Private Direct Messages (kinds 14 chat rumor, 15 file rumor)
- **NIP-44**: Versioned Encryption (v2, used for seal and gift wrap payloads)
- **NIP-59**: Gift Wrap (kinds 13 seal, 1059 gift wrap, randomized gift-wrap timestamp)
- **NIP-51 / NIP-65 adjacent**: Kind 10050 DM relay list

## Event Kinds

All DM-related kinds are defined in `src/constants.ts` (`ExtendedKind`). Emoji reactions and seal/gift wrap come from `nostr-tools`' `kinds` export.

| Kind  | Constant                                   | Source      | Purpose                                                        |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 7     | `kinds.Reaction`                           | nostr-tools | Emoji reaction to a DM message, wrapped the same way as chat   |
| 13    | `kinds.Seal` / `ExtendedKind.SEAL`         | nostr-tools | NIP-59 seal (encrypted rumor, signed by sender's identity key) |
| 14    | `ExtendedKind.RUMOR_CHAT`                  | extended    | Plaintext chat rumor (NIP-17 `kinds.PrivateDirectMessage`)     |
| 15    | `ExtendedKind.RUMOR_FILE`                  | extended    | Encrypted file attachment rumor                                |
| 1059  | `kinds.GiftWrap` / `GIFT_WRAP`             | nostr-tools | NIP-59 outer gift wrap (random-key signed)                     |
| 4454  | `ExtendedKind.CLIENT_KEY_ANNOUNCEMENT`     | extended    | Per-device client keypair announcement (for multi-device sync) |
| 4455  | `ExtendedKind.KEY_TRANSFER`                | extended    | Encrypted encryption-privkey transfer between devices          |
| 10044 | `ExtendedKind.ENCRYPTION_KEY_ANNOUNCEMENT` | extended    | Publishes the user's DM encryption public key (`n` tag)        |
| 10050 | `ExtendedKind.DM_RELAYS`                   | extended    | User's DM relay list (NIP-17)                                  |

## Architecture

### Encryption layers (send)

```
Rumor (kind 14 chat / 15 file / 7 reaction, unsigned) — plaintext
  └─ Seal (kind 13, signed by sender's identity key) — NIP-44 v2 to recipient's encryption pubkey
      └─ Gift Wrap (kind 1059, signed by ephemeral random key) — NIP-44 v2 to recipient's encryption pubkey
```

The seal is **signed by the sender's identity key** (so `seal.pubkey === rumor.pubkey`, which is what authenticates the sender), but its NIP-44 payload is still encrypted with the **dedicated encryption keypair** (`senderEncryptionPriv ↔ recipientEncryptionPub`). Because the seal is identity-signed, `seal.pubkey` is no longer the encryption pubkey, so the sender's encryption pubkey is carried in an **`n` tag** on the seal — this lets the recipient derive the conversation key locally without a Kind 10044 lookup, and the identity signature over that tag makes the binding self-authenticating. The encryption privkey is still only ever used for NIP-44 encrypt/decrypt, never for signing.

> **Legacy format & dual-send migration**: older clients signed the seal with the _encryption_ key (so `seal.pubkey` was the encryption pubkey and there was no `n` tag). `unwrapGiftWrap` detects this by the absence of the `n` tag and falls back to reading `seal.pubkey`, so historical gift wraps re-synced from relays still decrypt. During the migration window, each send **dual-publishes** both formats: `createDualGiftWraps` wraps the _same_ rumor as an identity-signed gift wrap (index 0) and a legacy encryption-key-signed gift wrap (index 1), for both the recipient and the sender's own devices. New clients read the identity-signed copy, clients still on the old code read the legacy copy. Because both copies share the same `rumor.id`, the receiver dedupes by id (`dmMessages` keyPath `id` + UI id-set filter) and only ever stores/shows one message. Once legacy clients are gone, drop `createLegacySeal` and send only index 0.

Two layers of NIP-44 encryption with two independent keypairs (the ephemeral random key in the gift wrap and the sender's encryption key in the seal payload) is what gives NIP-17 its metadata privacy: a relay can only see "some ephemeral pubkey sent some gift wrap to some encryption pubkey", not who is talking to whom.

The app uses **manual** gift wrap construction (see `src/services/nip17-gift-wrap.service.ts:32`) rather than `nostr-tools`' `createWrap`, because it needs **two `p` tags** on the gift wrap:

- `['p', recipientEncryptionPubkey]` — for NIP-17 subscribers indexing by encryption key
- `['p', recipientMainPubkey]` — so clients subscribing with `#p: [myMainPubkey]` still see their messages

Only the **gift wrap** `created_at` is randomized up to 2 days in the past via `randomTimeUpTo2DaysInThePast()` (`nip17-gift-wrap.service.ts`) — the gift wrap timestamp is the one relays see, so it must be obfuscated to defeat timing-based deanonymization. The **seal** `created_at` carries the real send time (`dayjs().unix()`): the seal is encrypted inside the gift wrap and never exposed to relays, so randomizing it buys no privacy (only the recipient, who already knows the sender, can read it), while a truthful timestamp avoids misleading clients that inspect the seal.

### Self-copies

Every send also produces **self gift wraps** via `createDualGiftWraps` (`nip17-gift-wrap.service.ts`), addressed to the sender's own encryption pubkey and published to the sender's own DM relays. This is how the sender's other devices pick up their own outgoing messages during sync. During the dual-send migration window this is a pair (identity-signed + legacy), same as the recipient copies.

### Dual Key System

- **Encryption Key** (`Kind 10044`): Long-lived keypair used as the NIP-44 endpoint for DMs. The public key is published in an `n` tag; the private key is stored per-account in `LocalStorage` (`ENCRYPTION_KEY_PRIVKEY_MAP`) and can be re-shared with new devices via Key Transfer.
- **Client Key** (`Kind 4454`): Per-device ephemeral keypair, one per browser/device. Its only purpose is to bootstrap Key Transfer so an old device can encrypt the Encryption privkey for a new device without the user typing a secret. Stored in `CLIENT_KEY_PRIVKEY_MAP`.
- **Account / Identity Key**: The Nostr identity pubkey. **Never** used for DM encryption/decryption — that is exclusively the Encryption Key's job. It signs the announcement events (`10044`, `4454`, `10050`), the `4455` key transfer envelope, **and every message seal (kind 13)** so the recipient can authenticate the sender from the seal alone. (Identity-signing each seal means one signer call per send — acceptable because the privacy win of the dual-key system is that the signer never has to _decrypt_, which would otherwise happen constantly in the background.)

### Relay strategy

- DM relays come from the user's `Kind 10050` list; they are distinct from the regular read/write relays.
- When sending, gift wraps go to **both** the recipient's DM relays _and_ the sender's own DM relays (so the sender's other devices can sync).
- Default DM relays (for users who haven't configured any) are defined in `src/constants.ts` — currently `nip17.com`, `offchain.pub`, `nos.lol`, `relay.primal.net`.

### Storage

- **IndexedDB** (`jumble` DB, schema **v20**): all durable DM state — `dmMessages`, `dmConversations`, `dmRelaysEvents`, `encryptionKeyAnnouncementEvents`. See "IndexedDB schema" below.
- **LocalStorage**: small scalars and keys — encryption privkey, client privkey, sync cursors, last-read timestamps, processed sync-request IDs.

### Routing

- Primary: key `'dms'` → `DmPage` (`src/routes/primary.tsx`)
- Secondary: path `'/dms/:pubkey'` → `DmConversationPage` (`src/routes/secondary.tsx`, `hideBottomBar: true`)
- Link helper: `toDmConversation(pubkey)` in `src/lib/link.ts` — encodes the pubkey as npub.

## Key flows

### Setup state machine (`DmPage`)

```
loading → need_login → need_relays → need_encryption_key → need_sync → ready
```

Implemented as `TSetupState` in `src/pages/primary/DmPage/index.tsx:27`.

- `loading` — checking local/remote state
- `need_login` — user not logged in
- `need_relays` — user has no `Kind 10050` published
- `need_encryption_key` — user has DM relays but no `Kind 10044` (offers to generate one)
- `need_sync` — a `Kind 10044` already exists remotely but no local privkey (offers Key Transfer)
- `ready` — has relays + local keypair, DM service initialized

**Fast path**: if a local keypair exists, `DmPage` enters `ready` immediately and then does a background `checkDmSupport` to detect key rotation on another device. If the remote `n` tag differs from the local pubkey, it drops the local key and re-enters `need_sync`.

### Sending a chat message

1. `DmInput` serializes content (mentions → `nostr:npub...`, custom emoji → `:shortcode:`).
2. `dmService.sendMessage(accountPubkey, recipientPubkey, content, replyTo?, additionalTags?)`:
   a. `getRecipientEncryptionPubkey(recipientPubkey)` fetches `Kind 10044` (or falls back to the encryption pubkey learned from an earlier received gift wrap, stored on the conversation record).
   b. `nip17GiftWrapService.createDualGiftWraps` produces `{ rumor, recipientGiftWraps, selfGiftWraps }` — each array is `[identity-signed, legacy]` for the dual-send migration.
   c. The self gift wraps are addressed to the sender's own encryption pubkey so other devices sync outgoing messages.
   d. Message record is written to IndexedDB and added to the optimistic UI (`sending` status).
   e. `publishGiftWraps` publishes each set in parallel — recipient set to recipient DM relays, self set to sender DM relays. A failure of the current-format recipient wrap (index 0) marks the message `failed`; legacy-format and self-copy failures are only logged.
   f. Sending status transitions to `sent` (auto-cleared after 3s) or `failed`. `pendingPublishData` holds the payload so `resendMessage(id)` can retry without reconstructing.

### Sending a file

1. `cryptoFileService.encryptFile(blob)` → `{ encryptedBlob, key, nonce, originalHash }` (AES-256-GCM, 256-bit key, 12-byte IV, SHA-256 of plaintext).
2. Upload `encryptedBlob` to the configured Blossom / media service.
3. `dmService.sendFileMessage(...)` builds a `Kind 15` rumor whose `content` is the URL and whose tags carry the decryption metadata:
   ```
   ['file-type', mimeType]
   ['encryption-algorithm', 'aes-gcm']
   ['decryption-key', hexKey]
   ['decryption-nonce', hexNonce]
   ['ox', originalSha256Hex]
   ['dim', 'WxH']       // optional, images
   ['size', '<bytes>']  // optional
   ['thumbhash', '...'] // optional, base64 thumbhash for images
   ```
4. Same wrap + publish path as a chat message.

### Reactions

`dmService.sendReaction(accountPubkey, recipientPubkey, messageId, emoji, emojiTag?)` builds a `Kind 7` rumor (content = emoji or `:shortcode:`, tag `['e', messageId, relayHint]`, optional `['emoji', ...]`) and wraps it with the same NIP-17 pipeline. Reactions are saved as `TDmMessage` rows (same store) so they survive sync and are rendered as grouped chips under the target bubble. They are excluded from `lastMessageRumor` on conversations. There is no explicit "retract" event — removing a reaction means deleting the local row.

### Receiving messages

`dmService.init(accountPubkey, encryptionKeypair)` does two things:

1. **Sync past events** via `initMessages` using two independent cursors:
   - **Forward cursor**: `DM_LAST_SYNCED_AT_MAP[accountPubkey]` — the last time a full sync completed. On next init, fetch gift wraps with `since = lastSynced - DM_TIME_RANDOMIZATION_SECONDS` (2 days of slack for NIP-59 time randomization), paginated forward in batches of 1000.
   - **Backward cursor**: `DM_BACKWARD_CURSOR_MAP[accountPubkey]` — an `until` timestamp used to paginate older history. Set to `0` when the full history has been fetched (sentinel for "done").
2. **Open a live subscription** on the user's DM relays for:
   - `Kind 1059` with `#p: [accountPubkey]` — new gift wraps
   - `Kind 4454` authored by the user — incoming sync requests from other devices
   - `Kind 10044` authored by the user — encryption key rotation from another device

For each incoming gift wrap: `unwrapGiftWrap` → `createMessageFromUnwrapped` → `saveMessage` (always persists, no account filtering) → `updateConversation` (per-account), then emits `newMessage` / `newReaction`.

### Soft-deleting a conversation

`dmService.deleteConversation(accountPubkey, otherPubkey)`:

1. Loads the conversation record by `accountPubkey:otherPubkey`.
2. Sets `deleted = true`, `deletedAt = now`, `hasReplied = false`, `unreadCount = 0`; **message rows are never touched**.
3. Future reads (`getMessages`, `getConversations`) filter out messages with `createdAt ≤ deletedAt` and hide conversations where `deleted === true`.
4. If a new message arrives with `createdAt > deletedAt`, `updateConversation` sets `deleted = false` again but keeps `deletedAt`, so old history remains hidden. `hasReplied` is left `false`, so the resurrected conversation re-enters the **Requests** tab rather than the main list — the user must actively reply to trust it back into Messages.

This design is the reason dm messages are keyed by a symmetric **participants key** rather than an account-scoped conversation key — see the data model section.

### Multi-device Key Sync (Client Key / Key Transfer)

**New device** (no local encryption privkey, user clicks "Sync from another device"):

1. `publishClientKeyAnnouncement` publishes `Kind 4454` with `['client', <description>]`, `['pubkey', clientPubkey]`, `['P', clientPubkey]`. Both `pubkey` and `P` tags exist because different implementations pick different conventions — coop uses `pubkey`, the draft NIP uses `P`.
2. `subscribeToKeyTransfer` opens a subscription for `Kind 4455` events tagging `['p', clientPubkey]`.
3. When a `4455` arrives, `importKeyFromTransfer` NIP-44-decrypts its content with `(myClientPrivkey, senderClientPubkey)`. If the plaintext is a valid 32-byte hex, it's stored as the encryption privkey for the account.

**Old device** (has the encryption privkey, listening on its own DM relays for `Kind 4454` from the same user):

1. `dmService` sees the new `4454`, checks `PROCESSED_SYNC_REQUEST_IDS` to avoid re-prompting, then emits a `syncRequest` event.
2. `KeySyncRequestDialog` shows the new device's name and asks the user to approve.
3. On approval, `exportKeyForTransfer` builds a `Kind 4455`:
   - `content` = NIP-44(senderClientPrivkey, recipientClientPubkey, encryptionPrivkeyHex)
   - tags `[['P', senderClientPubkey], ['p', recipientClientPubkey]]`
   - Signed by the identity key, published to the user's own DM relays.
4. `markSyncRequestProcessed(eventId)` records the 4454 id so the prompt doesn't re-fire on the next init.

### Reading / unread tracking

- `setActiveConversation` / `clearActiveConversation` track which thread is currently open. `updateConversation` uses this to skip incrementing `unreadCount` for messages that arrive while the user is looking at the thread.
- `markConversationAsRead` writes `LAST_READ_DM_TIME_MAP[accountPubkey:otherPubkey] = now` and zeroes `unreadCount`.
- `useDmUnread` aggregates the unread count across conversations, filtering out muted pubkeys and applying trust-score filtering to the Requests tab.

## Data model

### `TDmMessage` (`src/types/index.d.ts`)

```ts
type TDmMessage = {
  id: string // rumor id (NIP-01 event hash of the unsigned rumor)
  participantsKey: string // sorted([pubkeyA, pubkeyB]).join(':') — symmetric, account-agnostic
  senderPubkey: string // rumor.pubkey (real sender, NOT observer)
  content: string // text for kind 14 / reactions, URL for kind 15
  createdAt: number // rumor.created_at
  originalEvent: Event // the gift wrap (kind 1059) actually published/received
  decryptedRumor: Event // kind 14 / 15 / 7 rumor after unwrap
  replyTo?: {
    id: string
    content: string // resolved lazily by resolveReplyTo()
    senderPubkey: string
    tags?: string[][] // present for file replies (to recover mime / thumb)
  }
}
```

**Why `participantsKey`, not `conversationKey`?** Messages are deduplicated by rumor `id`, which is symmetric — the same message has the same hash from both endpoints. If we keyed the index by `accountPubkey:otherPubkey`, two accounts on the same device DMing each other would overwrite each other's rows and lose messages after an account switch. Sorting both pubkeys makes the key observer-independent.

### `TDmConversation`

```ts
type TDmConversation = {
  key: string // `${accountPubkey}:${otherPubkey}` — account-scoped
  pubkey: string // other party's main pubkey
  lastMessageAt: number
  lastMessageRumor?: Event // latest non-reaction rumor (drives preview text)
  unreadCount: number
  hasReplied: boolean // drives Messages vs Requests classification
  encryptionPubkey?: string // learned from received gift wrap seals
  deleted?: boolean // soft-delete flag; hidden from list when true
  deletedAt?: number // unix seconds; messages older than this are permanently hidden for this account
}
```

Conversations are **per-account** even though messages are shared: each of the user's logged-in accounts has its own unread count, last-read pointer, deletion state, and learned encryption pubkey for the other party.

### `TEncryptionKeypair`

```ts
type TEncryptionKeypair = {
  privkey: Uint8Array // raw 32 bytes, persisted as hex in LocalStorage
  pubkey: string // lowercase hex, 64 chars
}
```

## IndexedDB schema (DB: `jumble`, version **20**)

`src/services/indexed-db.service.ts` is the authoritative reference. DM-relevant stores:

| Store                             | Key path | Indexes                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dmMessages`                      | `id`     | `participantsCreatedAtIndex` = `[participantsKey, createdAt]` |
| `dmConversations`                 | `key`    | `lastMessageAtIndex` = `lastMessageAt`                        |
| `dmRelaysEvents`                  | `key`    | —                                                             |
| `encryptionKeyAnnouncementEvents` | `key`    | —                                                             |

### Migration history

- **v19** — cleared and resynced DMs after an earlier account-scoped key change.
- **v20** (current) — cursor-walks every `dmMessages` row to derive `participantsKey` from the old `conversationKey`, drops `conversationCreatedAtIndex`, creates `participantsCreatedAtIndex`, then cursor-walks `dmConversations` to migrate `localStorage.dmDeletedConversationsMap` onto the `deleted` / `deletedAt` fields (setting `deleted = lastMessageAt <= deletedAt` so a conversation with post-deletion activity is already resurrected on load). The localStorage key is removed afterwards. **No data is cleared.**

## LocalStorage keys (`src/constants.ts`, `StorageKey`)

| Key                          | Type                                             | Purpose                                                                                      |

All DM LocalStorage reads/writes go through `src/services/local-storage.service.ts`. The older `DM_DELETED_CONVERSATIONS_MAP` key was removed in v20 — do not reintroduce it.

## Service API surface (dm.service.ts)

The dm.service singleton is the single entry point other code touches. Key public methods (all under the default export):

```ts
init(accountPubkey, encryptionKeypair): Promise<void>
reinit(): Promise<void>
resetEncryption(): void
destroy(): void

// Sending
sendMessage(accountPubkey, recipientPubkey, content, replyTo?, additionalTags?): Promise<TDmMessage | null>
sendFileMessage(accountPubkey, recipientPubkey, fileUrl, mimeType, encryptionKey, encryptionNonce, originalHash, dim?, size?, thumbHash?): Promise<TDmMessage | null>
sendReaction(accountPubkey, recipientPubkey, messageId, emoji, emojiTag?): Promise<TDmMessage | null>
resendMessage(messageId): Promise<void>
getSendingStatus(messageId): 'sending' | 'sent' | 'failed' | undefined

// Reading
getConversations(accountPubkey): Promise<TDmConversation[]>  // filters out deleted
getConversation(accountPubkey, otherPubkey): Promise<TDmConversation | null>
getMessages(accountPubkey, otherPubkey, options?): Promise<TDmMessage[]>  // applies deletedAt filter
markConversationAsRead(accountPubkey, otherPubkey): Promise<void>
deleteConversation(accountPubkey, otherPubkey): Promise<void>  // soft delete

// Identity helpers
checkDmSupport(pubkey): Promise<{ hasDmRelays, hasEncryptionKey, encryptionPubkey }>
getRecipientEncryptionPubkey(pubkey): Promise<string | null>
getConversationKey(a, b): string         // 'a:b' — account-scoped, for dmConversations
getParticipantsKey(a, b): string         // sorted 'min:max' — symmetric, for dmMessages

// Sync / multi-device
importMessages(accountPubkey, rumors): Promise<number>  // bulk-import decrypted rumors (used by import tool)
resolveReplyTo(message): Promise<TDmMessage>            // lazily fills message.replyTo content/sender
markSyncRequestProcessed(eventId): void

// Active-conversation tracking (affects unread counting)
setActiveConversation(accountPubkey, otherPubkey): void
clearActiveConversation(accountPubkey, otherPubkey): void
isActiveConversation(accountPubkey, otherPubkey): boolean

// Listeners
onNewMessage(fn): unsubscribe
onNewReaction(fn): unsubscribe
onDataChanged(fn): unsubscribe
onSendingStatusChanged(fn): unsubscribe
onSyncRequest(fn): unsubscribe           // incoming Kind 4454 from other devices
onEncryptionKeyChanged(fn): unsubscribe  // remote Kind 10044 rotation observed
```

## Export / import

`DmPage` exposes Download / Upload buttons (`src/pages/primary/DmPage/index.tsx`). Export dumps all rumors for the account as newline-delimited JSON via `indexedDb.getAllDmMessagesForAccount(accountPubkey)` and filters the participantsKey by account inclusion. Import calls `dmService.importMessages(accountPubkey, rumors)`, which reuses the same save path as live messages (including `updateConversation`).

## Things to watch out for when reusing this code

1. **Always use `participantsKey` for message indexing, `conversationKey` for conversation indexing.** Mixing them is the exact bug v20 fixed.
2. **Gift wraps must carry two `p` tags.** `nostr-tools`' `nip59.wrapEvent` only writes one — use the custom `createGiftWrap` in `nip17-gift-wrap.service.ts`.
3. **Only the gift wrap `created_at` must be randomized — not the seal.** The gift wrap timestamp is what relays see, so it is randomized up to 2 days in the past; using `dayjs().unix()` there would leak timing. The seal's `created_at` is encrypted inside the gift wrap and only ever read by the recipient (who already knows the sender), so it carries the real send time — randomizing it would buy no privacy.
4. **Self gift wraps are not optional.** Without them, the sender's other devices never see their own outgoing messages. During the dual-send migration each send emits a `[identity-signed, legacy]` pair for the recipient AND for self; both copies share one `rumor.id` so the receiver dedupes to a single message.
5. **The identity key signs, the encryption key encrypts — keep them separate.** Seals (kind 13) and the announcement/transfer events (10044, 4454, 4455) are signed by the **identity** key; gift wraps (1059) are signed by an ephemeral key. The **encryption** privkey is used only for NIP-44 encrypt/decrypt and the seal's `n` tag — never for signing. The recipient learns the sender's encryption pubkey from the seal's `n` tag (current format) or `seal.pubkey` (legacy format).
6. **Soft-delete is per account, but messages are shared.** Filtering happens at read time using `conversation.deletedAt`. Never use `deleteDmMessagesByParticipantsKey` unless you are certain no other account on the device uses the same rows.
7. **Key rotation is detected at DmPage init, not proactively.** If you want push-driven detection, the relay subscription already listens to `Kind 10044` and emits `onEncryptionKeyChanged`; wire it into your UI.
8. **Forward-sync needs a 2-day slack.** Because NIP-59 randomizes `created_at` up to 2 days in the past, always subtract `DM_TIME_RANDOMIZATION_SECONDS` from the stored `lastSyncedAt` before using it as `since`.
9. **Relay-level DM support is a user-discoverable prerequisite.** `useDmSupport(pubkey)` checks both relays and encryption key and should gate any "Message" button in profile UIs.
