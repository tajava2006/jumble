## Run Locally

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/CodyTseng/jumble.git

# Go into the repository
cd jumble

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the app
npm run dev
```

For a web-only build on a system that cannot download the Electron binary, skip that download while keeping platform-specific build dependencies such as Rollup:

```bash
ELECTRON_SKIP_BINARY_DOWNLOAD=1 npm install
npm run build
```

## Run Docker

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/CodyTseng/jumble.git

# Go into the repository
cd jumble

# Run the docker compose
docker compose up --build -d
```

After finishing, access: http://localhost:8089

## Run as Desktop App (Electron)

Jumble can also run as a native desktop app via Electron. The desktop build runs all relay WebSockets in the main process (bypassing Chrome's per-origin connection cap) and stores secrets in the OS keychain via Electron's `safeStorage`.

```bash
# Clone and install (same as above)
git clone https://github.com/CodyTseng/jumble.git
cd jumble
npm install

# Start in dev mode (vite dev server + auto-launch Electron)
npm run electron:dev

# Build a distributable for the current platform
# Output goes to release/<version>/
npm run electron:build

# Preview a production build without packaging
npm run electron:preview
```

The web build (`npm run dev`, `npm run build`) is unaffected and never loads any Electron-only code.

## Community mode (Optional)

If you want to run Jumble in community mode (with pre-configured relay sets and relays), you can set the following environment variables in a `.env` file at the root of the project:

- `VITE_COMMUNITY_RELAY_SETS`: Environment variable. Set the default relay sets for Jumble. Multiple relay sets can be configured. If configured, the first preset group will be displayed to visitors by default upon opening. Visitors cannot delete relay sets preset by administrators. This is ideal for communities wishing to host their own Jumble instances or for setting default feeds for family members. Examples:

```
VITE_COMMUNITY_RELAY_SETS=[{"id": "example.com", "name": "The Example Feed", "relayUrls": ["wss://relay.example.com/", "wss://relay.example.org/"]},{"id": "dailynews", "name": "News", "relayUrls": ["wss://news.example.com/", "wss://news.example.org/"]}]
```

- `VITE_COMMUNITY_RELAYS`: Environment variable. Set additional default relays for Jumble. Multiple relays can be configured, separated by commas. These relays will be added to the preset relay sets and cannot be removed by visitors. Examples:

```
VITE_COMMUNITY_RELAYS="wss://relay.example.com/,wss://relay.example.org/"
```
